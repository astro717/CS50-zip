- By taking all the energy, valence and danceability of every song
  and making the avg of each so we can see wich category is more predominant
  and infer wether the listener's aura is more in the energized or melancolic side.

  listener might have spend most of his time in the first most listened songs and
  in out formula the weight of the 100 songs is the same even if one song has been
  listened way more times than other.
